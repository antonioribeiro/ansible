Installing Ansible
------------------

If you your workstation is a Debian based system (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, etc.), you can use the install-ansible.sh script:

```
curl https://raw.github.com/antonioribeiro/dev-box/master/install.sh > /tmp/install.sh && source /tmp/install.sh
```

Or you can just install Ansible manually: [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/intro_installation.html)

Make sure you have at least Ansible 1.3 running fine:

```
ansible --version
```
